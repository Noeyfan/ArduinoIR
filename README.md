ArduinoIR
=========

It's a project repo for the Arduino IR project.

The aim this week is to implement the LCD.

Which should be done in the LCD folder, I will put some demon and you can try to make some changes and see how it works.

The change can be made directly to the LCD file and push again

### Push code

Now you can run one command to push 
```ruby
    $ rake push
```

Progress for now
